In keeping with the times, Consequence of Sound formed the Consequence Podcast Network (CPN). Led by Director Cap Blackard, the network plans to shift the publication’s 10-year-old brand into the podcast arena with a series of exciting shows that reflect, evolve, and expand Consequence of Sound‘s original content in new and refreshing ways.<br>

“At Consequence, we’ve always held true to being a down-to-earth, personal voice in the world of media journalism,” Blackard says. “There’s no modern platform more personal than podcasts, and I’m excited that our fans and media-lovers in general get to know us even more intimately than before. We’re gonna have a lot of fun.”<br>
